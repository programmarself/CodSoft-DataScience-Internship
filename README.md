 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Scikit-learn library for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Commonly used models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.
Time series models (e.g., ARIMA or SARIMA) for predicting sales over time.
Regression models if you have additional features influencing sales.
Scikit-learn library for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Common classification models like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks.
